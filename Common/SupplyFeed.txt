Supply Feed

This will limit the input amounts of items transferred. Best used from a larger storage box that will act as
the warehouse. The target boxes are meant to just be topped off with the target amount.

● What you need to edit
● Edit the variable change-this-variable-name-5
Multi instance and you need to change each one and use something else from your first variable on the last set.

● Now you need to edit the input box input-fridge-bins to this 05-Food-*
Now the supply is from both fridges instead of the sort bin

● Now you need to edit the output box fridge-to-input-food-proc to 05-Food-Input-TT

● Now put the item id’s into the proper ID list

Last is the new line
{{~set 'Amount' 50}}
it’s set to 50 but change 50 to however many you want to supply
