Recieving only requires a box name 'CargoIn'
Sending requires a box named CargoOut@TargetVesselID
You can only have one CargoIn box per Vessel/Base. You can have multiple CargoOut@TargetVesselID boxes.

Items are shipped via the CargoOut boxes and Items are recieved via the CargoIn boxes. 

When sending items placed them in the container that matches the destination you are sending to which is the base or vessel id. ie CargoOut@1234

Shipping: drop Items in manually or use supporting scripts to move items into CargoOut@VesselOrBaseID boxes 
Recieving: retrieve items manually or use supporting scripts to move items from the CargoIn box to desired location
#there is no way to request items per se, you can only ship items.
