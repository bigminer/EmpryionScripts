This script will simply turn on/off a device when a player sits in a cockpit chair.
This sets the E.S.Pilot.Name to not empty
In this case we will always turn on the shields on and gravity off when seated.
When not seated the gravity will be turned on. I imagine there are lots of neat ways
to use the pilot feature
